QGIS Mineral Prospectivity Plugin - H5PY-FREE VERSION
====================================================

✅ FIXED: Eliminated h5py dependency completely to avoid DLL conflicts
✅ NOW USES: GDAL's built-in HDF5/NetCDF support (already included with QGIS)

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
- QGIS 3.22 or higher
- Python 3.8+ (included with QGIS)

INSTALLATION STEPS:

1. INSTALL REDUCED PYTHON DEPENDENCIES
   Open QGIS Python Console (Plugins -> Python Console) and run:

   import subprocess
   import sys
   
   # Streamlined package list - NO h5py needed!
   packages = [
       'numpy', 'scipy', 'pandas', 'scikit-learn', 'matplotlib', 
       'scikit-fuzzy', 'spectral', 'opencv-python', 'scikit-image', 
       'netcdf4', 'Pillow'
   ]
   
   for package in packages:
       try:
           subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", package])
           print(f"✅ Installed {package}")
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"❌ Failed to install {package}: {e}")

   # Optional GIS packages (may have dependency issues in some QGIS installations)
   optional_packages = ['rasterio', 'geopandas']
   for package in optional_packages:
       try:
           subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", package])
           print(f"✅ Installed optional {package}")
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"⚠️  Optional package {package} failed - plugin will work without it: {e}")

2. INSTALL THE PLUGIN
   - Download mineral_prospectivity_plugin_NO_H5PY.zip
   - QGIS -> Plugins -> Manage and Install Plugins -> Install from ZIP
   - Select the ZIP file and install
   - Enable the plugin after installation

3. VERIFY INSTALLATION
   - Plugin should load without any h5py-related errors
   - HDF5 files will be read using QGIS's built-in GDAL support
   - All functionality preserved, better compatibility

KEY IMPROVEMENTS IN THIS VERSION:
✅ Removed h5py dependency completely
✅ Uses GDAL's native HDF5 support (already in QGIS)
✅ Eliminates Windows DLL conflicts
✅ Fewer dependencies to install
✅ More stable and compatible
✅ Same functionality, better reliability

SUPPORTED FILE FORMATS:
- HDF4/HDF5 files (via GDAL) ✅
- NetCDF files (via GDAL + netcdf4) ✅
- GeoTIFF, JPEG2000, ENVI formats ✅
- ASTER L2 Surface Reflectance ✅
- Sentinel-2 data ✅
- Vector formats (Shapefile, GeoPackage, etc.) ✅

WHAT THIS FIXES:
❌ "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'h5py'"
❌ "DLL load failed while importing h5py"
❌ "ImportError: DLL conflicts with h5py"
❌ Windows-specific h5py installation issues

If you had h5py problems before, this version should resolve them completely!
